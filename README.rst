About
=====

PyAnsys Heart is a Python library developed by the Ansys Healthcare Research
team to model the human heart using Ansys LS-DYNA software. Designed to support
advancements in cardiovascular research, this tool enables detailed,
patient-specific simulations of heart function, capturing complex interactions
like fluid-structure-electrophysiology interaction (FSEI). These simulations
replicate hard-to-measure features such as structural stress, electrical
activity, muscle fiber orientation, and even account for anatomical elements
like the pericardium, valves, and atria.

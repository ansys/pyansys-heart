(b)	 The parties shall use all reasonable efforts to identify Other Confidential Information as provided above; however, Other Confidential Information shall also include information which, given the circumstances surrounding the disclosure or the nature of the information itself, can be reasonably understood to be confidential or proprietary even if such information is not so marked. The Recipient agrees (i) to hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) not to use it in any way (except as is necessary in support of the Purpose), commercially or otherwise; and (iii) not to disclose it to any unauthorized person, either before or after expiration or termination of this Agreement, without the Disclosing Party's prior written consent.  The Recipient further agrees to protect the Confidential Information, using either the same degree of care used to protect its own confidential or proprietary information of like importance or a reasonable degree of care, whichever degree of care is higher. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to its and its Affiliate’s employees who have a need to know in connection with the exercise of Recipient’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  “Affiliate” means any person or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such party. “Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
(c)	The Recipient's obligation of confidence and non-disclosure shall not apply to information that (i) was in the Recipient's possession before receipt from the Disclosing Party, (ii) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of the Recipient, (iii) is rightfully received by the Recipient from a third party without a duty of confidentiality, (iv) is independently developed by the Recipient without the use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information,  (v) is rightfully obtained by the Recipient from third parties authorized to make such disclosure without restriction.  Recipient may disclose Confidential Information if required by law, regulation or court order to be disclosed, so long as Recipient notifies Disclosing Party in writing prior to disclosing the Confidential Information so that Disclosing Party has an opportunity to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy from the proper authority.  Recipient agrees to cooperate with Disclosing Party in seeking such order or other remedy.  Recipient further agrees that if Disclosing Party is not successful in precluding the requesting legal body from requiring the disclosure of the Confidential Information, it will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.

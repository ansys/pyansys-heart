==================

You can test a new feature before it is officially released. To do
so, you can install PyAnsys Heart from the source code by performing the
steps in the following child topics.

Clone the repository
--------------------

Clone and install the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/ansys/pyansys-heart

Install for users
-----------------

Install the latest version of PyAnsys Heart to test the latest features as
they are being developed, without having to wait for releases.

Set up a virtual environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Navigate to the project's root directory:

   .. code-block::

       cd pyansys-heart

#. Create a new virtual environment named ``.venv`` to isolate your system's
   Python environment:

   .. code-block:: text

       python -m venv .venv

3. Activate this environment:

   .. tab-set::

       .. tab-item:: Windows

           .. tab-set::

               .. tab-item:: CMD

                   .. code-block:: text

                       .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

               .. tab-item:: PowerShell

                   .. code-block:: text

                       .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

       .. tab-item:: macOS/Linux/UNIX

           .. code-block:: text

               source .venv/bin/activate

Install the latest version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Install PyAnsys Heart in editable mode:

   .. code-block:: text

       python -m pip install .

2. Verify the installation by checking the version of the library:

   .. code-block:: python

       from ansys.health.heart import __version__


       print(f"PyAnsys Heart version is {__version__}.")

   .. jinja::

       .. code-block:: text

       >>> PyAnsys Heart version is {{ PYANSYS_HEART_VERSION }}.

.. _start-a-discussion:

on the `PyAnsys Heart Discussions`_ page.

.. _answer-questions:

Install from a wheel file
-------------------------

if you lack the internet connection, you can install PyAnsys Heart from a wheel file.
You should install PyAnsys Heart by downloading the wheelhouse archive for your
corresponding machine architecture from the repositoryâ€™s
`Release page <https://github.com/ansys/pyansys-heart/releases>`_.

Each release contains a wheel file for the corresponding Python version and
machine architecture. For example, to install the wheel file for
Python 3.10 on a Windows machine, run the following command:

.. code:: bash

    unzip pyansys-heart-v0.6.1-wheelhouse-windows-latest-3.12.zip wheelhouse
    pip install pyansys-heart -f wheelhouse --no-index --upgrade --ignore-installed

If you are on Windows with Python 3.12, unzip the wheelhouse archive to a wheelhouse
directory and then install using the same pip install command as in the preceding example.

Consider installing using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages. For more information,
refer to the `Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_.
